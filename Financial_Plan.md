## Documentation of expense assumptions
#### Liability Insurance
- For our first year, we will have $500,000 in coverage. Our second year we will up that to a million, and then two million for year three.
#### Advertising
- For start-up and year one, we will advertise on Google and Facebook, we will also sponsor a local little league team. We will use the same forms of advertising for years two and three, doubling the budget each year. 
#### Legal
- For start-up, we will pay a retaining fee for a lawyer to help us with any legal issues that may arise. For years two and three, we expect to have most bugs sorted out and thus will not need as much legal help.
