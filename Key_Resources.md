# Key Resources

#### Start-up Costs

- We will need a large amount of start-up funding for this business. We estimate we will need at least $500,000 to start this business. We will meet this demand by selling off personal assets, securing investors, and by taking out a small business loan. 

#### People and Departments

- As a new business it would serve us well to have a team of lawyers readily available, especially since our business interacts with people's private data. There may also be unexpected legal issues that pop up here and there, so it will be reassuring to know that we have trusted and adequate legal representation. We will need help securing intellectual resources, such as brands, patents, copyrights, partnerships, and customer databases we develop.  

- We will also need a talented financial department that will upkeep company records and maintain compliance with the IRS.  We will go through a very selective interview process to select the best viable candidates for our managerial positions. Of course our talented team will need adequate financial software to keep records. For this we will provide them with NetSuit, a popular financial management software.   

- We understand that stress can play a negative effect on our daily lives. To better serve our team members across all dimensions of their well-being, we will employ a wellness program. This wellness program will include fitness classes, flexible work schedules, free healthy food, annual flu shots, financial planning, and partial gym reimbursement.

- We will also need talented engineers and marketing experts with creative and extensive technical knowledge and driven by empathy to ensure our customers receive the best possible products and services. We will utalize Verizon One Talk for Business for our communication system. We will also have a few company vehicles for for employees to meet with customers.   

#### Hardware: 

- Hardware will undoubtedly be an essential resource to ensure we maintain an innovative culture throughout the company. As a digital security business everything we do depends on the performance of our hardware. We will only source the best products from the most reputable suppliers. We will need encrypted portable drives, encrypted desktop drives, and secure servers. We will also offer remote work, so we will need to ensure that all our employees have access to top notch internet services. SkyNet will ensure the creation of a global infrastructure that has enough data centers to house the cloud storage and computing power necessary to adequately service our customers. Until then, we will elicit cloud storage from IBM.
